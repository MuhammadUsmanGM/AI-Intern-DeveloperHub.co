# AI/ML Engineering Internship Portfolio

This repository contains the complete set of AI/ML projects completed as part of the DevelopersHub AI/ML Engineering Internship program.

## Portfolio Dashboard

The `portfolio_dashboard_app.py` file contains a Streamlit application that combines all the individual projects into a single interface. This allows you to navigate between different applications from one dashboard.

To run the portfolio dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run portfolio_dashboard_app.py
```

## Individual Projects

Each project is organized in its respective task folder:

- **Task 1**: Iris Dataset Exploration
- **Task 2**: Stock Price Prediction
- **Task 3**: Heart Disease Prediction (includes heart_disease_predictor_app.py)
- **Task 4**: General Health Chatbot (includes health_chatbot_app.py)
- **Task 5**: Mental Health Chatbot (includes mental_health_chatbot_app.py)
- **Task 6**: House Price Prediction (includes house_price_predictor_app.py)

Each task folder contains the Jupyter notebook, README, and any associated Streamlit applications.

## Requirements
